									<h2>Who I Am</h2>
									<p>A nerd that seeks out adventure. Simple as that, or at least on the surface. Like all of us I am the sum of my experiences
										and passions. Hopefully some of what I share below will help you understand you I am, and perhaps will encourage you
										to share you experiences as well. I would love to get in contact with you, so connect with me using the links below!

								<h3>Professional Life</h3>
								<p>For the past 3 years I have spent nearly all my working hours on data analytics and building a strong technical foundation.
									My passion for data and data driven decision making has led me down the path to Junior Data Scientist and helped build significant
									trust in my organization. My focus has been squarely on helping the many teams in a large organization derive more value from
									their data. This has not always been easy, but it has been supremely rewarding and had tremendous impact on the company at large.

									The next phase of my career journey is to build further on the quantitative skills I have been over the past 3-4 years and to
									improve my managerial and leadership skills. Leadership at any level is critical to success, and does not require a team to 
									direct. I want to build on what I have learned in work and school and focus on continuous improvement such that I can lead up, down
									and laterally.
								</p>

								<h3>Personal Life</h3>
								<p>I am an avid runner and love exploring the many trails in the Michigan woods and Colorado mountains. Marathons and adventurous
									trails like the Rim to Rim in the Grand Canyon are some of my favorite trips. Beyond running, I love to travel, both within the US
									and internationally. Experiencing new cultures and trying new activites and foods is exhilirating. Although I am not a great culinary
									artisan, I also enjoy cooking dishes from the places we visit; the spicier the better!
								</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Education</h3>
								<p>After graduating early from high school I was blessed with the opportunity to study abroad at East China Normal University in Shanghai,
									China. This experience helped me solidify my plans for the future and showed me how getting out of our comfort zones is one 
									of the best ways to improve ourselves. After my time in China, I returned to Michigan to study at the University of Michigan. At UofM I
									spend much of my time in the Economics department, but ultimately decided that the more descriptive nature of Political Science
									and the study of social sciences was more enjoyable (theory is great, pragmatism is more useful). After completing my B.A. at UofM I
									spent a time in industry while I decided what the next phase should be. This is when I developed my strong passion for technology
									and data. Once it was clear that data was my career future, I attended Elmhurst University to work on my M.S. in Data Science. Upon 
									completion, and while studying, I was able to accerelate my learning and focus more on machine learning and management skills.

									<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
									<p>Life is best lived when challenging ourselves. From new technologies to longer adventures, pushing beyond my current limits is 
										what I love to do. Finding those new limits and collaborating with talented people is where I want to be, hopefully that next
										stage is just around the corner, and maybe you will be the one to show me what else there is to explore!
