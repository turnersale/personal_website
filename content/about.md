My name is Turner Sale and I am a Junior Data Scientist in Colorado Springs, CO. I have a passion for interesting analysis, learning and running. I am continually expanding my skillset and love to learn new technologies, even those that are not a part of my normal work life. Using data to make a difference, both professionally and personally is my passion and I would love to use this in an organization that pursues excellence.

## My Hobbies
Running is my passion, hiking is my guilty pleasure and travel is my desire. I have a myriad of interests that change frequently (from gardening to electric motorcycles) and love to explore new activities with people that are far better than I am.

* Running
  * Multiple marathons and half marathons
  * Burgeoning Ultramarathoning 
  * The more meters of elevation gain the better!
* Hiking
  * Completed the Rim to Rim of the Grand Canyon, twice, perhaps not the smartest idea
  * Frequent ascents of local Colorado mountains, including several 14ers
* Travel
  * Lived in both China and Argentina
  * Hate the airport security line, but love the feeling of landing in a new place
